"You look like you're trying to add a route based on your wireless network. Do you need some help?"

A very simple bash script designed to automatically change network settings depending on what network you are connected to, named after the most riduculous personal assistant ever. Simply add in the variables in conf and set it to run from cron every minute. 

This is really just a small framework and can be expanded to do anything you need, or add in elif statements to deal with multiple networks. 

This is obviously provided as-is with no warranty of any kind. If it breaks or screws something up ... sorry.
